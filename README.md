# CS-260-Assignment-4

In this assignment, we will create a linked list with some functions to enhance the maneuverability of our linked list. 
Our code will have 3 functions. Our first function will allow us to add values to our list in any given position. 
The second function will allow us to select a value at any given position and remove the value. It will also be able to return that value. 
The last function will allow us to view any value at any position without deleting or removing it.
